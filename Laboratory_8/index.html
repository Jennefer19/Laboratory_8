    <h1>Laboratory Activity 8</h1>
    <p>Summers had a logic all their own and they always brought something out in me.</p>
    <p>Summer was supposed to be about freedom and youth and no school and possibilities and adventure and exploration.</p>
    <p>Summer was a book of hope. That's why I loved and hated summers. Because they made me want to believe.</p>
